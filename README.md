Baye's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Baye Getnet, an aspiring full-stack web developer. This repository is a collection of projects and exercises that I've completed while taking The Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

About The Course
The Complete Web Development Bootcamp is the only course you need to learn to code and become a full-stack web developer. Taught by the brilliant Dr. Angela Yu, it covers a wide array of web development topics, including but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB.

Throughout this course, I've learned not only the fundamentals of web development but also best practices and modern web development frameworks. I've built several projects from scratch, which have helped me solidify my understanding and skills in full-stack development.

Projects
Below is a list of projects included in this repository. Each project comes with a brief description, what I learned from it, and a link to see it live (if applicable).
